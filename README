simplehistogram

A very simple ndarray-based histogram class.

=============================================

Matplotlib histograms are geared around drawing, not
data manupulation. This is intended to turn into a set of
very lightweight classes for shuffling data around. This is
very much a work-in-progress.

type "make test" to run the unit tests.

Vague usage:
(see the hists.py docstring for probably more
up-to-date instructions)


Initialise with bin indices:
  >>> a = Hist([0, 1, 2, 3])
  >>> a.bincount
  3
  >>> a.bins
  (0, 1, 2, 3)
  >>> a.data
  array([ 0.,  0.,  0.])

Optionally include data and optional dtype:
  >>> a = Hist([0, 1, 2, 3], data=[1, 0.2, 3], dtype=float)
  >>> a.data
  array([ 1. ,  0.2,  3. ])

You can do arithmetic operations in place or seperately:
  >>> a = Hist([0, 1, 2, 3], data=[1, 0.2, 3])
  >>> b = a + a
  >>> b -= a
  >>> a.data == b.data
  array([ True,  True,  True], dtype=bool)  

And you can fill bins from values:
  >>> a = Hist([0,1,2,3])
  >>> a.fill(1.4, weight=3)
  >>> a.data
  array([ 0.,  3.,  0.])
